**Purpose:**
This project analyzes two datasets: Petal_Data and Sepal_Data. The code merges these datasets, converts string columns to numeric values, and calculates various statistical measures such as correlation, average, median, and standard deviation.

**Input**

Petal_Data.csv: A CSV file containing data related to petal measurements.

Sepal_Data.csv: A CSV file containing data related to sepal measurements.

**Output**

Combined DataFrame: The merged dataset contains both petal and sepal data.

Correlation Matrix: A matrix showing the correlation between different variables.

Average Values: The mean of each variable in the combined dataset.

Median Values: The median of each variable in the combined dataset.

Standard Deviation: The standard deviation of each variable in the combined dataset.


**Imported Libraries**

pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.

**Code process**

pd.read_csv: Reads CSV files into DataFrames.

pd.merge: Merges two DataFrames on specified columns.

pd.to_numeric: Converts string columns to numeric values, coercing errors to NaN.

.corr(): Calculates the correlation matrix.

.mean(): Calculates the mean of each variable.

.median(): Calculates the median of each variable.

.std(): Calculates the standard deviation of each variable.

print(): Displays the results.

**Limitations**

The code assumes that the CSV files are correctly formatted and contain the necessary columns (sample_id and species).

String columns that cannot be converted to numeric values will be set to NaN.

The code does not handle missing values or outliers.
